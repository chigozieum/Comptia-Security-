Exercise 1 - Open Service Ports
Open service ports provide a communication path for services hosted on a machine. Opening service ports is critical for normal and effective network operations. However, open service ports may also serve as a path for attack, especially if they are unnecessarily open and unmanaged.

Nmap is an open-source network scanning tool that can be used to identify open ports on a machine.

In this exercise, you will use nmap to discover unnecessary open ports on ACIDM01, then close those ports using the Windows Defender Firewall.

Learning Outcomes
After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

Discover Unnecessary Open Ports
Close Unnecessary Open Ports
Your Devices
You will be using the following devices in this lab. Please power these on now.

ACIDC01 - Windows Server 2022 - Domain Controller
ACIDM01 - Windows Server 2022 - Domain Member Server
ACIKALI - Kali Purple 2023.1 - Stand-alone Linux Workstation
Task 1 - Discover Unnecessary Open Ports
An unnecessary open port is a network port that is open and accessible, but that serves no legitimate purpose or function on the host (in the context of the network configuration). Unnecessary open ports provide potential entry points for an attacker and should be discovered and shut.

In this task, you will use nmap to discover unnecessary open ports.

Step 1
Connect to ACIDM01.

Click the Start charm, then select XAMPP > XAMPP Control Panel.

Figure 1.6 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the Terminal and conducting a port scan on ACIDM01.
Figure 1.6 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the Terminal and conducting a port scan on ACIDM01.
Note: For our scenario, ACIDM01 is not meant to run a web server or host a MySQL database. These are considered unnecessary services and have unnecessary ports open to support them.
The -Pn switch is used to bypass the host discovery step of the nmap port scan.
Step 7
In the Terminal window, type the following and press Enter:

nmap -Pn -A -p 80,443,3306 192.168.0.2
Figure 1.7 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the Terminal and running an aggressive nmap scan on the suspect open ports.
Figure 1.7 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the Terminal and running an aggressive nmap scan on the suspect open ports.
Note: In order to find out more information about the unexpected open ports, an aggressive (-A) nmap scan is performed. This scan combines four nmap capabilities:
1) A service version scan
2) An operating system detection scan
3) Traceroute
4) Custom scripts
This scan is being run on only the three unexpected ports.
Step 8
Notice that Apache 2.4.56 is running on ports 80 and 443 and that a MariaDB is running on port 3306. These ports are unnecessarily open and should be closed.

Figure 1.8 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the output of the nmap command in the Terminal window.
Figure 1.8 Screenshot of ACIKALI: Displaying the output of the nmap command in the Terminal window.
Keep the Terminal Emulator window open on  .
Task 2 - Close Unnecessary Open Ports
Unnecessary open ports provide potential entry points for an attacker. In this case, ports 80, 443, and 3306 are open, even though there is no intention of ACIDM01 hosting a website. In this case, these ports should be closed.

The Windows Defender Firewall is a built-in security feature that protects the machine from unauthorized access. It acts as a barrier to protect the host from unwanted and unauthorized communication.

In this task, you will use the Windows Defender Firewall to close ports 80, 443, and 3306 on the ACIDM01 machine.

Step 1
Connect to  .

Exercise 2 - Default Credentials
Default credentials are widely known and predictable. For example, the website cirt.net, which is the Cyber Incident Response Team Network, hosts a Default Password Database comprised of 531 vendors and 2117 default passwords.

Default credentials, when left on vendor equipment, make the equipment an easy target for unauthorized access.

Guest accounts may use default passwords or sometimes no password at all. They are accounts that are intended to provide limited privileges and access to the network. However, from an attacker's perspective, a Guest account is an attack vector.

In this task, you will discover the Guest account on ACIDC01 and disable it.

Note: This simulates the victim activating the payload by opening the malicious PDF.
Step 22
Observe Adobe Reader, attempt to open the file, then close.

This vulnerability requires the installation of the vulnerable software on a Windows XP operating system. Because this operating system is Windows 11, the exploit will fail. However, indicators of the attack can still be observed.

Close the Downloads and Microsoft Edge windows.
Task 3 - Observe Indicators of Attack
Not all attacks are successful. However, indications of attack, even unsuccessful attacks, must still be identified so the network can be secured.

In this task, you will use Microsoft Event Viewer to discover indicators of attack on Adobe Reader 8.1.1 from a malicious PDF. Though the attack was unsuccessful, the process of an attacker being able to install a vulnerable application and deliver a malicious PDF that was opened indicates there are significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.

Step 1
Connect to ACIWIN11.

Click the Start charm and type the following:

event viewer
Select Event Viewer from the Best match pop-up menu.

Step 4
Observe the recent Errors in the Application Logs. Discover in the General description of the log that the application that caused the error was AdobeRd32.exe. This is Adobe Reader 8.1.1, and these errors were caused when the malicious PDF was opened.

Close the Event Viewer window.

Note: Though this exploit was not successful, the logs provide an indicator of attack. Additionally, even without being able to execute the malicious PDF, an attacker was able to deliver a weaponized PDF, potentially through phishing or social engineering, and a victim user downloaded the file and attempted to open it. These are significant security issues that must be addressed through a cyber incident response process.











Review
Well done, you have completed the Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces Practice Lab.

In this lab, you discovered unnecessary open ports on a domain server and mitigated the vulnerability, discovered and then disabled a Guest account on the Domain Controller, and identified indicators of attack on a user workstation.

Summary
You completed the following exercises:

Exercise 1 - Open Service Ports
Exercise 2 - Default Credentials
Exercise 3 - Vulnerable Applications
You should now be able to:

Discover Unnecessary Open Ports
Close Unnecessary Open Ports
Discover the Guest Account
Disable the Guest Account
Discover a Recently Installed Application
Simulate an Attack on the Vulnerable Application
